## FAQ's

**What is SMP, SMK and Peppol Directory**


1. *Peppol Directory*:
   - The *Peppol Directory* is an *OpenPEPPOL AISBL* service that provides a centralized registry for Peppol participants. It allows you to search for entities based on their name, address, ID, or other keywords. You can find information about Peppol service providers, organizations, and their associated details.
   - Access the Peppol Directory [here](https://directory.peppol.eu/public).

2. *SMK (Service Metadata Key)*:
   - The *SMK* is a unique identifier assigned to each Peppol participant. It serves as a reference key for locating specific participants within the Peppol network.
   - Think of it as a digital address that helps direct messages to the right recipient.

3. *SMP (Service Metadata Provider)*:
   - The *SMP* is a decentralized registry for technical metadata related to Peppol eDelivery services.
   - Its main functions include:
     - Publishing and maintaining metadata about Peppol participants (such as their endpoints, supported document types, and certificates).
     - Allowing participants to discover each other's capabilities.
   - The SMP plays a crucial role in enabling secure and efficient message exchange within the Peppol network.
   - For full support, it integrates with the *Peppol Directory, **SMK, and the **SML (Service Metadata Locator)*.

4. *Peppol Directory [TEST]*:
   - There's also a test version of the Peppol Directory for experimentation and validation purposes.
   - You can access the test directory [here](https://test-directory.peppol.eu/public/).

**How to get a Peppol PKI Certificate**


To obtain a *Peppol PKI test certificate*, follow these steps:

1. *Access Point (AP) Deployment: Ensure that you have a deployed **Access Point (AP)*. The AP acts as the gateway for exchanging Peppol eDelivery messages.

2. *Test Environment Setup*:
   - Set up a *Peppol Testbed* environment. This testbed helps service providers (SPs) implement Peppol eDelivery specifications and verify their compliance.
   - Make sure you have access to the *eDelivery test suite*, which consists of test cases to validate your capabilities for sending and receiving AS4 messages, performing SMK/SMP lookups, handling TLS and certificate issues, and managing large files.

3. *Certificate Enrollment*:
   - Request a *Peppol PKI test certificate* from a trusted certificate authority (CA) or a Peppol-authorized entity.
   - The certificate should be issued for your AP's domain or endpoint.

4. *Test Execution*:
   - Use the *AP Validation Tool* provided in the testbed environment.
   - Enroll the test certificate in your AP.
   - Execute the relevant test cases from the eDelivery test suite.
   - Ensure successful completion of the tests.

5. *Validation and Compliance*:
   - Validate that your AP complies with Peppol specifications.
   - Address any issues or errors identified during testing.
   - Once your AP passes the tests, you'll have a valid Peppol PKI test certificate.

6. *References*:
   - Refer to Peppol specifications, policies, and standards for detailed guidance throughout the process.


**What does PKI Client Authentication means?**


*PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) client authentication* refers to the process of verifying the identity of a client (such as a user or device) during communication over a network. Here's how it works:

1. *Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)*:
   - PKI is a framework that manages digital certificates and keys for secure communication.
   - It involves the use of asymmetric cryptography, where each participant has a pair of keys: a *public key* (shared openly) and a *private key* (kept confidential).
   - Certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) bind a public key to an identity (such as a person or organization).

2. *Client Authentication*:
   - When a client (e.g., a user's web browser or a device) connects to a server (e.g., a website), client authentication ensures that the client is who it claims to be.
   - Here's how it works:
     - The server requests the client to present a digital certificate.
     - The client sends its certificate, which contains its public key and identity information.
     - The server verifies the certificate:
       - It checks if the certificate is valid (not expired, signed by a trusted CA, etc.).
       - It decrypts the client's digital signature using the public key from the certificate.
       - If the signature matches, the client is authenticated.
     - Once authenticated, secure communication (such as HTTPS) can proceed.

3. *Use Cases*:
   - *Web Browsers*: When you visit a secure website (HTTPS), your browser presents its certificate to the server for authentication.
   - *VPN (Virtual Private Network)*: Clients connecting to a VPN server authenticate using certificates.
   - *Smart Cards*: Physical smart cards contain certificates for user authentication.
   - *IoT Devices*: Devices in an IoT network can use PKI for secure communication.

4. *Benefits*:
   - *Strong Security*: PKI ensures robust authentication and confidentiality.
   - *Non-Repudiation*: Clients cannot deny their actions because their private key signs transactions.
   - *Scalability*: PKI scales well for large networks.


**What does AS4 Specifications mean?**


1. *Definition*:
   - *AS4* is an *open standard* designed for the *secure and payload-agnostic exchange* of *Business-to-business (B2B)* documents using *Web services*.
   - It ensures reliable and confidential communication between trading partners.

2. *Key Technical Highlights*:
   - *Interoperability: AS4 adheres to the **OASIS standard*, promoting compatibility across different systems.
   - *Security: AS4 employs a subset of **web services security features* to ensure *non-repudiation* of messages and data confidentiality.
   - *Reliability: By exchanging confirmations, AS4 ensures **one-time delivery* of messages.
   - *Payload Agnosticism: AS4 allows the exchange of **any type of payload* (EDI, XML, etc.) without being tied to specific SOAP actions or operations.

3. *Use Cases*:
   - AS4 can be used in various contexts, including *Business-to-Business (B2B), **Administration-to-Administration (A2A), **Administration-to-Business (A2B), and **Business-to-Administration (B2A)* message exchanges.
   - It accommodates different document types and payloads.

4. *Standardization*:
   - AS4 became an *OASIS standard* in 2013 and an *ISO standard* in 2020.
   - Its adoption simplifies the complexities of Web services, providing an entry-level on-ramp for B2B communication.

**What is TLS and it's abbreviation**


The abbreviation *TLS* stands for *Transport Layer Security*. It is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over computer networks, including the Internet¹². Here are some key points about TLS:

- *Purpose*: TLS ensures privacy and data security during communication between web applications and servers. It encrypts data to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
- *Evolution: TLS evolved from an earlier protocol called **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)*. Although the terms TLS and SSL are sometimes used interchangeably, TLS replaced SSL in 1999.
- *Components*:
  - *Encryption*: Hides data from third parties.
  - *Authentication*: Ensures that communicating parties are who they claim to be.
  - *Integrity*: Verifies that data hasn't been forged or tampered with.
- *TLS Certificates*: To use TLS, a website or application must have a TLS certificate (also known as an "SSL certificate"). These certificates are issued by certificate authorities and bind a domain to a public key.
